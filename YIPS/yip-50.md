## Summary

Seize ~8 YFI from treasury [contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x93A62dA5a14C80f265DAbC077fCEE437B1a0Efde) and use these funds as a first step to create contributors' stash.

## Rationale

Normally, all tokens sitting in treasury [contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x93A62dA5a14C80f265DAbC077fCEE437B1a0Efde) are recycled – sold for yCRV and send as rewards to YFI stakers.

Proposal is to start a slow paced accumulation of YFI for future contributors – seize ~8.005026733686906244 YFI currently sitting in treasury.

### Voting

**For**: Seize ~8 YFI from treasury [contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x93A62dA5a14C80f265DAbC077fCEE437B1a0Efde).

**Against**: Leave funds for recycling.

**Note:** 7-days voting poll is **binding** (live until Nov 12). We should have the implementation ready shortly after.
